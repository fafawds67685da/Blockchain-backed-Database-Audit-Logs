# Blockchain-backed-Database-Audit-Logs
Our project secures organizational data by combining traditional databases with blockchain immutability. Instead of storing raw data on-chain, we store cryptographic hashes of entries. This provides a cost-effective proof-of-existence: records can be verified by re-hashing, ensuring integrity, transparency, and protection against tampering.
